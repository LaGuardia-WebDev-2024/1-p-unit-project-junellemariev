    <h1>The Big Pooty</h1>
        
    <h2>What is a Pooty?</h2>

    <p> Pooty is my dog <br>
        He likes scratching walls <br>
        But Pooty is not big, <br>
        He's not even a foot tall! <br>
        He came into my life my sophomore year. <br>
        He came as a surprise to everyone here. <br>
        And although he's not big, his booty sure is <br>
        The Big Booty Pooty, what a perfect fit!</p>

    <h2>Why is he <em>The</em> Pooty?</h2>

    <p>Because he is the only one! The only Pooty in the world to live with me and my family.</p>

    <h2>Why You Should Get a Pooty</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>he's got a big booty</li>
