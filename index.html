    <h2>What is a Pooty?</h2>

        <img src="1000015676.jpg" width="200" style="float:right">

    <p> Pooty is my dog <br>
        He likes scratching walls <br>
        But Pooty is not big, <br>
        He's not even a foot tall! <br>
        He came into my life my sophomore year. <br>
        He came as a surprise to everyone here. <br>
        And although he's not big, his booty sure is <br>
        The Big Booty Pooty, what a perfect fit!</p>

    <h2>Why is he <em>The</em> Pooty?</h2>

    <p>Because he is the only one! The only Pooty in the world to live with me and my family. <br>
    <em><strong>Did you know?...</strong></em>Pooty's full government name is <ins>Pluto Manuel R. Virtusio</ins></p>

    <h2>Why You Should Get a Pooty</h2>
